# Three.js and Next.js Practice Project

Welcome to my Three.js and Next.js practice project! This repository is designed
for learning and experimenting with Three.js within a Next.js application. This
branch is corresponding to the chapters from the
["Discover Three.js"](https://discoverthreejs.com/book/first-steps/) book by the
author [Lewy Blue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewy-blue-30b9b193/).
