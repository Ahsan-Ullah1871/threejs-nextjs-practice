# Three.js and Next.js Practice Project

Welcome to my Three.js and Next.js practice project! This repository is designed
for learning and experimenting with Three.js within a Next.js application. The
project is organized into branches, with each branch corresponding to a chapter
from the ["Discover Three.js"](https://discoverthreejs.com/book/first-steps/)
book by the author [Lewy Blue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewy-blue-30b9b193/).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node
Package Manager) installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Ahsan-Ullah187/threejs-nextjs-practice.git
      ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

      ```bash
      cd threejs-nextjs-practice
      ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

## Branches

This project is organized into branches, with each branch corresponding to a
specific chapter from the "Discover Three.js" book. You can switch between
branches to practice and learn the concepts presented in the book. Here are some
of the available branches:

- `chapter-1` - Introduction to Three.js
- `chapter-2` - ...
- `chapter-3` - ...

Each branch will contain the code and examples related to that chapter.

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following commands:

- For development:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

     This will start a development server for your Next.js application.

- For production:

     ```bash
     npm run build
     npm start
     ```

     This will build and start the Next.js application in production mode.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `components/` - React components used in the application.
- `app/` - Next.js pages for routing.
- `public/` - Publicly accessible assets.
- `three/` - Three.js specific code and examples.

Happy coding and learning Three.js with Next.js!
