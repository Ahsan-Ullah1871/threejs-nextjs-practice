## Getting Started

To get started with this project, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node
Package Manager) installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Ahsan-Ullah187/threejs-nextjs-practice.git
      ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

      ```bash
      cd threejs-nextjs-practice
      ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

## Branches

This project is organized into branches, with each branch corresponding to a
specific chapter or by specific book or any other type practice (I will write a
good name fo that). You can switch between branches to practice and learn the
concepts

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following commands:

- For development:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

     This will start a development server for your Next.js application.

- For production:

     ```bash
     npm run build
     npm start
     ```

     This will build and start the Next.js application in production mode.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `components/` - React components used in the application.
- `app/` - Next.js pages for routing.
- `public/` - Publicly accessible assets.
- `three/` - Three.js specific code and examples.

Happy coding and learning Three.js with Next.js!
